## ⚙️ Bot Functions

### 🧑‍🎓 AutoOT
FusionBot automatically applies your **trainer information** based on the save file you’re currently using.  
- Your **OT / TID / SID / OTGender** are applied automatically.  
- To keep the trainer info in your own files, attach them with `t true`.  
- For Showdown Sets, simply include the OT/TID/SID you want and AutoOT will then be disabled.  

This ensures all trades feel natural and consistent with your game, while still letting you override it if you want custom trainer data.

---

### 🔗 Link Trade Codes
FusionBot assigns you a **personal static Link Trade Code** on your first trade.  
- This code is **unique to you** and stays the same for all future trades.  
- To reset it: use `dtc` (your next trade gives you a new random code).  
- To customize it: use `ctc 12345678` (sets your permanent code to whatever you choose).  

This makes trading smoother by removing guesswork, making your link code always ready.  

---

### 🏅 Medals & Milestones
Every trade you complete is tracked by FusionBot, and your **trade count** shows up in the footer of the trade embed.  
- For every **50 trades**, you earn a new medal 🥇.  
- You can check your medals anytime in your profile card with the `mi` command.  
- It’s just for fun; a little **progression system** to show off your trading dedication.  

Think of it like leveling up — the more you trade, the more medals you rack up.  

---

### 🤖 Reading DMs Sent to the Bot
You can now read the DMs a user sends to the bot. This is fun for when people think your bot is a real person and they attempt to speak to it, or get enraged at it because their internet sucks or don't have NSO. As sad as it is, sometimes users will send derogatory/racial/sexist messages to your bot thinking no one can see it, but now you can, and if they speak like that, do you really want them in your server? 
- Visit the **UserDMsToBotForwarder** option in `Hub -> Discord` and insert a Channel ID, then restart the bot.
- The DMs that get logged are only those without a command, so you will not get flooded with user command input.
- You'll also be able to see attachments users send to the bot, but beware, because it can get weird. I learned from experience.
